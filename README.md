# PoGoDa
A naive implementation of a Go Postgres driver. The primary goal of the project is to conform to the database/sql "interface" with as little programmer effort as possible. It MAY be a nice showcase of postgres wire protocol, as there are practically no "improvements" added to the flow.

## Pogoda is
* Simple
* Easy to understand (hopefully)

## Pogoda isn't
* Efficient / fast
